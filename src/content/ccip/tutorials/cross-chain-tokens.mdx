In this tutorial, you will use Chainlink CCIP to transfer tokens from a smart contract to an account on a different blockchain. First, you will pay for the CCIP fees on the source blockchain using LINK. Then, you will use the same contract to pay CCIP fees in native gas tokens. For example, you would use ETH on Ethereum or MATIC on Polygon.

<Aside type="caution" title="Transferring tokens">
  This tutorial uses the term "transferring tokens" even though the tokens are not technically transferred. Instead,
  they are locked or burned on the source chain and then unlocked or minted on the destination chain. Read the [Token
  Pools](/ccip/architecture#token-pools) section to understand the various mechanisms that are used to transfer value
  across chains.

## Before you begin

1. You should understand how to write, compile, deploy, and fund a smart contract. If you need to brush up on the basics, read this [tutorial](/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract), which will guide you through using the [Solidity programming language](https://soliditylang.org/), interacting with the [MetaMask wallet](https://metamask.io) and working within the [Remix Development Environment](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

1. Your account must have some ETH and LINK tokens on _Ethereum Sepolia_. Learn how to [Acquire testnet LINK](/resources/acquire-link).
1. Check the [Supported Networks page](/ccip/supported-networks) to confirm that the tokens you will transfer are supported for your lane. In this example, you will transfer tokens from _Ethereum Sepolia_ to _Polygon Mumbai_ so check the list of supported tokens [here](/ccip/supported-networks/testnet#ethereum-sepolia-polygon-mumbai).
1. Learn how to [acquire CCIP test tokens](/ccip/test-tokens#mint-test-tokens). Following this guide, you should have CCIP-BnM tokens, and CCIP-BnM should appear in the list of your tokens in MetaMask.
1. Learn how to [fund your contract](/resources/fund-your-contract). This guide shows how to fund your contract in LINK, but you can use the same guide to fund your contract with any ERC20 tokens as long as they appear in the list of tokens in MetaMask.

## Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will transfer [CCIP-BnM](/ccip/test-tokens#tokens) tokens from a contract on Ethereum Sepolia to an account on Polygon Mumbai. First, you will pay [CCIP fees in LINK](#transfer-tokens-and-pay-in-link), then you will pay [CCIP fees in native gas](#transfer-tokens-and-pay-in-native). The destination account can be an [EOA (Externally Owned Account)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#types-of-account) or a smart contract. Moreover, the example shows how to transfer CCIP-BnM tokens, but you can re-use the same example to transfer other tokens as long as they are supported for your [lane](/ccip/concepts#lane).

<CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/TokenTransferor.sol" />

### Deploy your contracts

To use this contract:

1. [Open the contract in Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/CCIP/TokenTransferor.sol).

1. Compile your contract.
1. Deploy and fund your sender contract on _Ethereum Sepolia_:

   1. Open MetaMask and select the network _Ethereum Sepolia_.
   1. In Remix IDE, click _Deploy & Run Transactions_ and select _Injected Provider - MetaMask_ from the environment list. Remix will then interact with your MetaMask wallet to communicate with _Ethereum Sepolia_.
   1. Fill in your blockchain's router and LINK contract addresses. The router address can be found on the [supported networks page](/ccip/supported-networks) and the LINK contract address on the [LINK token contracts page](/resources/link-token-contracts). For _Ethereum Sepolia_, the router address is <CopyText text="0xD0daae2231E9CB96b94C8512223533293C3693Bf" code/> and the LINK contract address is <CopyText text="0x779877A7B0D9E8603169DdbD7836e478b4624789" code/>.
   1. Click the **transact** button. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears on the _Deployed Contracts_ list.
      Note your contract address.
   1. Open MetaMask and fund your contract with CCIP-BnM tokens. You can transfer <CopyText text="0.002" code/> _CCIP-BnM_ to your contract.

1. Enable your contract to transfer tokens to _Polygon Mumbai_:
   1. In Remix IDE, under _Deploy & Run Transactions_, open the list of functions for your smart contract deployed on _Ethereum Sepolia_.
   1. Call the `allowlistDestinationChain` function with <CopyText text="12532609583862916517" code/> as the destination chain selector, and <CopyText text="true" code/> as allowed. Each chain selector is found on the [supported networks page](/ccip/supported-networks).

### Transfer tokens and pay in LINK

You will transfer _0.001 CCIP-BnM_. The CCIP fees for using CCIP will be paid in LINK. Read this [explanation](#transferring-tokens-and-pay-in-link) for a detailed description of the code example.

1.  Open MetaMask and connect to _Ethereum Sepolia_. Fund your contract with LINK tokens. You can transfer <CopyText text="0.01" code/> _LINK_ to your contract. **Note**: The LINK tokens are used to pay for CCIP fees.

1.  Transfer CCIP-BnM from _Ethereum Sepolia_:

    1. Open MetaMask and select the network _Ethereum Sepolia_.
    1. In Remix IDE, under _Deploy & Run Transactions_, open the list of transactions of your smart contract deployed on _Ethereum Sepolia_.

    1. Fill in the arguments of the _**transferTokensPayLINK**_ function:

       <br />

You can find all the addresses for each supported blockchain on the [supported networks page](/ccip/supported-networks). |
       | \_amount                   | <CopyText text="1000000000000000" code/> <br /> The token amount (_0.001 CCIP-BnM_).                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

    1. Click the **transact** button and confirm the transaction on MetaMask.
    1. Once the transaction is successful, note the transaction hash. Here is an [example](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xb423ad5650648f2856f67f6d8a9c0aa809aa7a86ab4e27b34721497e3a1d647c) of a transaction on _Ethereum Sepolia_.

    {" "}

    <Aside type="note">
      During gas price spikes, your transaction might fail, requiring more than _0.01 LINK_ to proceed. If your
      transaction fails, fund your contract with more _LINK_ tokens and try again.
    </Aside>

1.  Open the [CCIP explorer](https://ccip.chain.link/) and search your cross-chain transaction using the transaction hash.

                <br />

          <ClickToZoom

            alt="Chainlink CCIP Explorer transaction details"
          />

1.  The CCIP transaction is completed once the status is marked as "Success". The data field is empty because you are only transferring tokens.

                <br />

          <ClickToZoom

            alt="Chainlink CCIP Explorer transaction details success"
          />

1.  Check the receiver account on the destination chain:

    1. Note the destination transaction hash from the CCIP explorer. `0x7abd502d0cb62bf99f3075ef1f83237de2fd213d09a268eff021957ac1703312` in this example.
    1. Open the block explorer for your destination chain. For _Polygon Mumbai_, open [polygonscan](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/).
    1. Search the [transaction hash](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/tx/0x7abd502d0cb62bf99f3075ef1f83237de2fd213d09a268eff021957ac1703312).

## Explanation

The smart contract featured in this tutorial is designed to interact with CCIP to transfer a supported token to an account on a destination chain. The contract code contains supporting comments clarifying the functions, events, and underlying logic. This section further explains initializing the contract and transferring tokens.

### Initializing of the contract

When you deploy the contract, you define the router address and LINK contract address of the blockchain where you deploy the contract. The contract uses the router address to interact with the router to estimate the CCIP fees and the transmission of CCIP messages.

### Transferring tokens and pay in LINK

The `transferTokensPayLINK` function undertakes six primary operations:

1. Call the `_buildCCIPMessage` internal function to construct a CCIP-compatible message using the `EVM2AnyMessage` [struct](/ccip/api-reference/client#any2evmmessage):

   - The `_receiver` address is encoded in bytes to accommodate non-EVM destination blockchains with distinct address formats. The encoding is achieved through [abi.encode](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html).
   - The `data` is empty because you only transfer tokens.
   - The `tokenAmounts` is an array, with each element comprising a [`EVMTokenAmount` struct](/ccip/api-reference/client#evmtokenamount) that contains the token address and amount. The array contains one element where the `_token` (token address) and `_amount` (token amount) are passed by the user when calling the `transferTokensPayNative` function.
   - The `extraArgs` specifies the `gasLimit` for relaying the message to the recipient contract on the destination blockchain, along with a `strict` parameter. In this example, the `gasLimit` is set to `0` because the contract only transfers tokens and does not expect function calls on the destination blockchain. The `strict` parameter is set to `false`. **Note**: If `strict` is true and `ccipReceive` reverts on the destination blockchain, subsequent messages from the same sender will be blocked by CCIP until the reverted message can be executed.
   - The `_feeTokenAddress` designates the token address used for CCIP fees. Here, `address(linkToken)` signifies payment in LINK.

     {" "}

     <CcipCommon callout="extraArgsCallout" />

1. Computes the message fees by invoking the router's `getFee` [function](/ccip/api-reference/i-router-client#getfee).
1. Ensures your contract balance in LINK is enough to cover the fees.
1. Grants the router contract permission to deduct the fees from the contract's LINK balance.
1. Grants the router contract permission to deduct the amount from the contract's _CCIP-BnM_ balance.
1. Dispatches the CCIP message to the destination chain by executing the router's `ccipSend` [function](/ccip/api-reference/i-router-client#ccipsend).

**Note**: As a security measure, the `transferTokensPayLINK` function is protected by the `onlyAllowlistedChain` to ensure the contract owner has allowlisted a destination chain.

### Transferring tokens and pay in native

The `transferTokensPayNative` function undertakes five primary operations:

1. Call the `_buildCCIPMessage` internal function to construct a CCIP-compatible message using the `EVM2AnyMessage` [struct](/ccip/api-reference/client#any2evmmessage):

   - The `_receiver` address is encoded in bytes to accommodate non-EVM destination blockchains with distinct address formats. The encoding is achieved through [abi.encode](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html).
   - The `data` is empty because you only transfer tokens.
   - The `tokenAmounts` is an array, with each element comprising an `EVMTokenAmount` [struct](/ccip/api-reference/client#evmtokenamount) containing the token address and amount. The array contains one element where the `_token` (token address) and `_amount` (token amount) are passed by the user when calling the `transferTokensPayNative` function.
   - The `extraArgs` specifies the `gasLimit` for relaying the message to the recipient contract on the destination blockchain, along with a `strict` parameter. In this example, the `gasLimit` is set to `0` because the contract only transfers tokens and does not expect function calls on the destination blockchain. The `strict` parameter is set to `false`.
     **Note**: If `strict` is true and `ccipReceive` reverts on the destination blockchain, subsequent messages from the same sender will be blocked by CCIP until the reverted message can be executed.
   - The `_feeTokenAddress` designates the token address used for CCIP fees. Here, `address(0)` signifies payment in native gas tokens (ETH).

     {" "}

     <CcipCommon callout="extraArgsCallout" />

1. Computes the message fees by invoking the router's `getFee` [function](/ccip/api-reference/i-router-client#getfee).
1. Ensures your contract balance in native gas is enough to cover the fees.
1. Grants the router contract permission to deduct the amount from the contract's _CCIP-BnM_ balance.
1. Dispatches the CCIP message to the destination chain by executing the router's `ccipSend` [function](/ccip/api-reference/i-router-client#ccipsend). **Note**: `msg.value` is set because you pay in native gas.

**Note**: As a security measure, the `transferTokensPayNative` function is protected by the `onlyAllowlistedChain`, ensuring the contract owner has allowlisted a destination chain.
